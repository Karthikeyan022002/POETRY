When you miss your soul, 
when you suffer alone in agony, 
when your tears aren't accompanied by a smile, 
when your lips can't find the words, 
when you are merely existing 
when the mornings are gloomy
when you wait indefinitely when I miss that idiot why do I take this path when she is not meant to be mine my heart has given up. 
Love is complicated
