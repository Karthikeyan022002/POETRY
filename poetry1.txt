I'm thinking of her again.
it isn't the first time today and I know it won't be the last. 
while I'm thinking of her,my mind starts to drift in other areas, 
such as "I think of her but I'm not even certain she's even aware of my thoughts. 
I do know, she doesn't need me and her life would go on as normal,
but this beautiful woman is far from normal, 
the word normal in reference to her is a slap in the face.
because this woman is unique, intreaging, mysterious, breath taking far from normal.
her eyes are just as beautiful as her smile,in her presence my heart flutters a little faster and a little harder. 
I even thought "who am I to even try to win her heart even though her heart in unwinnable and can do a lot of beautiful wonders.
I think of her as a beautiful creation that I may catch a glimpse of but only for a moment because if I try to approach her I know I'll scare her away, 
so I'll admire her from afar like I always do with  hopes and dreams that she maybe admiring from afar, 
but there goes my ego again, reassuring something that can't be reassured, so I blink and then , 
she's gone again. so I blink and then wait until I can see her for that moment in hopes that our eyes might meet again.
i'd love nothing more than to wrap her in a blanket of pure love, because that's what she deserves,not me not her but more, 
even more than she can imagine.oh well I'll wait and wait and wait, until the stars line up and we become one or the sky falls and we become none, 
so today like most, I'll think of her,and also later I'll think of her.... 
but if somehow you are seeing this now, just know you deserve all and more
